# Recommendation-Engine-with-IBM

# Project Motivation
In this notebook, we implement a recommendation engine for the IBM Watson Studio Platform which consists of articles and user interactions with those articles. We develop our recommendation engine based on 3 different levels of complexities:
1. Simply using filters and rank based recommendations (Knowledge based recommendations)<br />
2. Looking at user-user based collaborative filtering recommendations (Algorithm for the computation and assessment of user-user similarity score)<br />
3. Using Singular Value Decomposition algorithm for predictions on users (Content based Recommendation)<br />

Additionally, we look at innovative ways to address the cold start problem and look more closely at the performance of the SVD algorithm with respect to number of latent features vis a vis the testing set and training set.




# Project Details
The project is broken down in the Jupyter notebook as follows:
I. Exploratory Data Analysis <br />
II. Rank Based Recommendations <br />
III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering <br />
IV. Cold start Problem with suggestions of improvement using NLP and ML pipeline on article data for alternative content based recommendations <br />
V. Matrix Factorization <br />
VI. Performance of SVD <br />
